**AI Dungeon Master** is a full-stack, RPG-themed productivity application engineered to combat executive dysfunction by gamifying project management. It transforms abstract user goals into structured, actionable questlines generated by an AI agent, creating a powerful feedback loop where real-world progress fuels in-game character advancement.

## üåü Project Overview

The core concept of this application is to provide a motivational tool for individuals who struggle with task initiation and project planning. By framing productivity in the engaging context of a role-playing game, it turns daunting goals into an adventurous quest. Users define an "epic quest" (a real-world project), and the AI Dungeon Master breaks it down into smaller, manageable tasks. Completing these tasks rewards the user with experience points (XP), level-ups, and unique, AI-generated loot items, complete with custom descriptions and AI-generated images, making productivity feel both rewarding and tangible.

### Key Features:
- **AI-Powered Goal Decomposition:** Leverages Large Language Models to intelligently break down complex user goals into a series of sequential, fantasy-themed quests.
- **Gamified Progression System:** A persistent character is tied to each user account. Completing real-world tasks directly contributes to the character's XP and level, creating a direct link between productivity and in-game success.
- **Dynamic AI-Generated Rewards:** Upon quest completion, the application generates a unique loot item with a thematic name, description, and a custom image created by an AI text-to-image model.
- **Interactive Project Management:** Users can manage multiple projects, each displayed as an expandable accordion. This allows for a clean overview of all ongoing "epics" and their associated quests.
- **Optimistic UI for Instant Feedback:** The frontend is designed for maximum user engagement, featuring optimistic UI updates that provide immediate feedback for actions like completing quests, while backend processes run in the background.
- **Secure Authentication:** A robust user authentication system using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) ensures that all user data, projects, and character progress are kept private and secure.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture

The application is built on a modern, decoupled MERN-stack architecture, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and allowing for independent development and deployment of the frontend and backend services.

| Category          | Technology / Service                                       |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Frontend** | React (Vite), Tailwind CSS, Zustand                        |
| **Backend** | Node.js, Express.js                                        |
| **Database** | MongoDB Atlas (with Mongoose)                              |
| **AI (Text)** | OpenRouter API (`nous-hermes-2-mixtral-8x7b-dpo`)            |
| **AI (Image)** | Hugging Face Inference API (`black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev`)  |
| **Authentication**| JSON Web Tokens (JWT), bcryptjs                            |
| **Deployment** | Vercel (Frontend), Render (Backend)                        |

## üöÄ Getting Started

To run this project locally, you will need to set up both the server and the client environments.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v20.x or later) and npm
- A MongoDB Atlas account and connection string
- An OpenRouter API Key
- A Hugging Face API Key with Inference access

### Backend Setup (`/server`)
1.  Navigate to the `server` directory: `cd server`
2.  Install dependencies: `npm install`
3.  Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and add your secret keys:
    ```env
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key
    OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key
    HUGGING_FACE_API_KEY=your_huggingface_api_key
    ```
4.  Start the server: `npm start`
    - The server will run on `http://localhost:1002` by default.

### Frontend Setup (`/client`)
1.  Navigate to the `client` directory: `cd client`
2.  Install dependencies: `npm install`
3.  Create a `.env` file in the `client` directory and add the backend API URL:
    ```env
    VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:1002/api
    ```
4.  Start the client development server: `npm run dev`
5.  Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port specified in the terminal).

## üí° Reflections & Future Work

This project was a comprehensive exercise in full-stack development, from initial concept and technical design to deployment. A key challenge was debugging persistent caching issues in the Node.js environment, particularly with Mongoose models, which was resolved by implementing more explicit schema definitions to force model recompilation. Another significant learning experience was integrating multiple third-party AI services and ensuring they worked together seamlessly and securely.

### Potential Future Enhancements:
- **Arena Mini-Game:** Implement a simple turn-based game where users can "fight" monsters using the loot they've acquired.
- **Social Features:** Add a "guild" or "party" system where users can share their progress or collaborate on projects.
- **Advanced Character Customization:** Allow users to choose a class (e.g., Warrior, Mage) that might grant bonuses for certain types of tasks.
- **Loot Caching:** Implement a caching layer on the backend to store and reuse generated images for common loot items, reducing API costs and improving performance.
